# HW2 Part 3 – Counting with a dictionary
#
# In `part3.py`:
#
# 1. Build a dictionary counting works per artist, and print it: `{'Vincent van Gogh': 1, ...}`. A
#    work with no artist counts under `'Unknown'`.
# 2. Print the artist with the most works: `Most works: Claude Monet (2)`
#
# (This is the letter-counting pattern from Class 3, applied to art.)

from artworks import artworks

counts = {}
for art in artworks:
    artist = art.get("artist", "Unknown")
    if artist in counts:
        counts[artist] = counts[artist] + 1
    else:
        counts[artist] = 1

print(counts)

most_artist = ""
most_counts = 0
for artist in counts:
    if counts[artist] > most_counts:
        most_counts = counts[artist]
        most_artist = artist

print(f"Most works: {most_artist} ({most_counts})")
